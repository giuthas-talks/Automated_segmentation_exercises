\frame{\frametitle{Land acknowledgement}

  The University of Alberta, its buildings, labs and research stations are
  primarily located on the territory of the Néhiyaw (Cree), Niitsitapi
  (Blackfoot), Métis, Nakoda (Stoney), Dene, Haudenosaunee (Iroquois) and
  Anishinaabe (Ojibway/Saulteaux), lands that are now known as part of Treaties
  6, 7 and 8 and homeland of the Métis. The University of Alberta respects the
  sovereignty, lands, histories, languages, knowledge systems and cultures of all
  First Nations, Métis and Inuit nations. 
  \vfill
  In addition to our university's written land acknowledgement I'd like to speak
  of my own relation to the lands where I have been working for almost a year now.

\frame{\frametitle{Introduction: The what and the why}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Segmentation can be explained, but actually getting good at it requires
  hands-on practice.
  \item While Praat \citep{BoersmaWeenink-PraatDoingPhonetics-2010} has an
  excellent segmentation interface, it does not provide a segmentation exercise
  interface.
  \item PATKIT \citep{PaloEtAl-PATKITPhoneticAnalysis-2025} copies Praat's
  segmentation interface and adds a resettable exercise feature. 
  \end{itemize}
}


\frame{\frametitle{Method: The how -- Setting up}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Open a directory with matching TextGrids and audio files in PATKIT.
  \item Go to: Exercises $\rightarrow$ Scramble TextGrids.
  \item If setting up for others, go to: Exercises $\rightarrow$ Save as exercise
  \ldots, to save the audio files and the scrambled TextGrids in a new location. 
\end{itemize}
}


\frame{\frametitle{Method: The how -- Running an exercise}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Either do the setup steps or get an exercise dataset from someone.
  \item If you want to compare your segmentation with the model, you'll
  need to get the model files too.
  \item Do the segmentation.
  \item Check how you are doing by going to: Exercises $\rightarrow$ Compare to
  model.
  \item Rinse and repeat.
\end{itemize}
