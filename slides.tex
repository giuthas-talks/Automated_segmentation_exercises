\frame{\frametitle{Land acknowledgement}

  The University of Alberta, its buildings, labs and research stations are
  primarily located on the territory of the Néhiyaw (Cree), Niitsitapi
  (Blackfoot), Métis, Nakoda (Stoney), Dene, Haudenosaunee (Iroquois) and
  Anishinaabe (Ojibway/Saulteaux), lands that are now known as part of Treaties
  6, 7 and 8 and homeland of the Métis. The University of Alberta respects the
  sovereignty, lands, histories, languages, knowledge systems and cultures of
  all First Nations, Métis and Inuit nations. 
  \vfill
  In addition to our university's written land acknowledgement I'd like to
  speak of my own relation to the lands where I have been working for almost a
  year now.

\frame{\frametitle{Introduction: The why}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Even in the age of 'AI' segmentation is a major bottle neck in getting
  phonetic research done fast.
  \item Segmentation is part of the essential skill set of a speech researcher
  in terms of understanding our data.
  \item Segmentation might even serve as a useful way into learning
  transcription.
  \item Segmentation rules vary with context of language, project, etc.
  \end{itemize}
}


\frame{\frametitle{Introduction: The what}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Segmentation can be explained, but actually getting good at it requires
  hands-on practice.
  \item While Praat \citep{BoersmaWeenink-PraatDoingPhonetics-2010} has an
  excellent segmentation interface, it does not provide a segmentation exercise
  interface.
  \item The Phonetic Analysis ToolKIT (PATKIT, the program previously known as
  SATKIT) \citep{PaloEtAl-PATKITPhoneticAnalysis-2025} copies (essential parts
  of) Praat's segmentation interface and adds a resettable exercise feature. 
  \end{itemize}
}


\frame{\frametitle{The Caveats}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item The exercises are not fully functional yet.
    \item Everything might change.
    \item I want your input for making this good.
  \end{itemize}

    \vfill
  }
  }


\frame{\frametitle{Method: The workflow}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Segment a bunch of data somewhere - for now probably in Praat.
    \item Alternatively, get a bunch of segmented data (TextGrids and e.g.
    wavs) from somewhere.
    \item Open the data directory in PATKIT as a new exercise.
    \item PATKIT scrambles the TextGrids.
    \item Segment away.
    \item Optional saving of answers to continue later and for things like
    inter-rater metrics. 
  \end{itemize}

\frame{\frametitle{Method: Installing PATKIT}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Install uv \url{https://docs.astral.sh/uv/}
  % \begin{itemize}
  %   \item Mac/Linux: 
  %   \begin{verbatim}
  %     curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
  %   \end{verbatim} 
  %   \item Windows:
  %   \begin{verbatim}
  %     powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"
  %   \end{verbatim}
  % \end{itemize} 
  \item On the commandline run:\\
    uv tool install patkit\\
    patkit
  \item This should print the commandline help.
\end{itemize}
}


\frame{\frametitle{Method: Running an example exercise/exercise}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Get the example data from\\ 
  \url{https://github.com/giuthas-talks/Automated_segmentation_exercises/}
  \item Put it in a couple of folders of your own choosing. 
  \item Run:\\
    patkit exercise [folder name]
  \item This should open the annotator GUI.
\end{itemize}
}


\frame{\frametitle{Method: Potential command names}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Exercises $\rightarrow$ Run as exercise
  \item Exercises $\rightarrow$ Create exercise\ldots
  \item Exercises $\rightarrow$ Save exercise\ldots 
  \item Exercises $\rightarrow$ New answer 
  \item Exercises $\rightarrow$ Open answer\ldots 
  \item Exercises $\rightarrow$ Save answer\ldots 
  \item Exercises $\rightarrow$ Compare to example answer
  \item Exercises $\rightarrow$ Show example answer
\end{itemize}
}


\frame{\frametitle{Discussion}
\begin{itemize}
  \item So, do you have thoughts?
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Which terms do you prefer? 
    \item Exercise vs exercise?
    \item Answer, model, solution?
    \item Any other ones?
  \end{itemize}
  \item What would make this more useful to you?
  \item What other features would be good to have?
\end{itemize}
