\frame{\frametitle{Land acknowledgement}

  The University of Alberta, its buildings, labs and research stations are
  primarily located on the territory of the Néhiyaw (Cree), Niitsitapi
  (Blackfoot), Métis, Nakoda (Stoney), Dene, Haudenosaunee (Iroquois) and
  Anishinaabe (Ojibway/Saulteaux), lands that are now known as part of Treaties
  6, 7 and 8 and homeland of the Métis. The University of Alberta respects the
  sovereignty, lands, histories, languages, knowledge systems and cultures of all
  First Nations, Métis and Inuit nations. 
  \vfill
  In addition to our university's written land acknowledgement I'd like to speak
  of my own relation to the lands where I have been working for almost a year now.

  \item Introduction: The what and the why
  \item Method: The how
  \item Demo - ish
  \item Discussion
  \item Want to have a go yourself?

}


\frame{\frametitle{Introduction: The what and the why}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Segmentation can be explained, but actually getting good at it requires
  hands-on practice.
  \item While Praat \citep{BoersmaWeenink-PraatDoingPhonetics-2010} has an
  excellent segmentation interface, it does not provide a segmentation exercise
  interface.
  \item PATKIT \citep{PaloEtAl-PATKITPhoneticAnalysis-2025} copies Praat's
  segmentation interface and adds a resettable exercise feature. 
  \end{itemize}
}


\frame{\frametitle{Method: The big caveats}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Does not work yet.
    \item Everything might change.
    \item I want your input for making this good.
  \end{itemize}
}


\frame{\frametitle{Method: Installing PATKIT}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Install uv \url{https://docs.astral.sh/uv/}
  % \begin{itemize}
  %   \item Mac/Linux: 
  %   \begin{verbatim}
  %     curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
  %   \end{verbatim} 
  %   \item Windows:
  %   \begin{verbatim}
  %     powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"
  %   \end{verbatim}
  % \end{itemize} 
  \item On the commandline run:\\
    uv tool install patkit\\
    patkit
  \item This should print the commandline help.
\end{itemize}
}


\frame{\frametitle{Method: Running an example assignment/exercise}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Get the example data from\\ 
  \url{https://github.com/giuthas-talks/Automated_segmentation_exercises/}
  \item Put it in a couple of folders of your own choosing. 
  \item Run:\\
    patkit exercise [folder name]
  \item This should open the annotator GUI.
\end{itemize}
}


\frame{\frametitle{Method: Setting up}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Open a directory with matching TextGrids and audio files in PATKIT as
  an exercise:\\
  ~~Exercises $\rightarrow$ Create assignment\ldots
  \item If setting up for others, go to:\\
  ~~Exercises $\rightarrow$ Save as exercise \ldots\\
  to save the audio files and the scrambled TextGrids in a new location. 
\end{itemize}
}


\frame{\frametitle{Method: Running an exercise}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Either do the setup steps or get an exercise dataset from someone.
  \item If you want to compare your segmentation with the model, you'll
  need to get the model files too.
  \item Do the segmentation.
  \item Check how you are doing by going to:\\
  ~~Exercises $\rightarrow$ Compare to model
  \item When wishing to re-run an exercise go to:\\
  ~~Exercises $\rightarrow$ Scramble TextGrids
  \item Rinse and repeat.
\end{itemize}

\frame{\frametitle{Discussion}
\begin{itemize}
  \item So, do you have thoughts?
  \item What would make this more useful to you?
  \item What other features would be good to have?
